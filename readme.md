# Attendbot 9000

An "easy" way to keep track of meeting attendance using Slack, Google Sheets (the best database), and the honor system.

## Setup

If you don't use Nix (yet) you must installing the following libraries:
- slack-bolt
- google-api-python-client
- google-auth-httplib2
- google-auth-oauthlib

Otherwise, `nix develop` works fine. Further instructions available in `docs.tex`.
